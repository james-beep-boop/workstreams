# ARES Lesson Library — AI Assistant Instructions

This file is loaded automatically by Claude Code at the start of every session.
The canonical project specification is **`Lesson2.md`** in this directory. Read it before making any architectural decisions.
Repository-specific guidance lives here. Shared Laravel / Filament / Pest / Boost framework rules live in **`AGENTS.md`** and should be maintained there only.

## Project summary

**ARES Kenya Lesson Plan Library** — a Laravel 13 / Filament 5 / Livewire 4 web application for teachers and administrators to store, version, browse, compare, and manage lesson plans.

**Working directory:** repository root

## Knowledge currency

Your training cutoff is **August 2025**. These packages in this project post-date that cutoff:

| Package | Version used |
|---|---|
| Laravel | 13 |
| Filament | 5 |
| Livewire | 4 |
| Laravel AI SDK (`laravel/ai`) | first-party, Laravel 13 era |

The exact release dates are less important than the rule: **treat your built-in knowledge of these packages as potentially wrong and verify before using.**

Before implementing any feature that touches Filament, Livewire, the Laravel AI SDK, or any Laravel 13-specific API:

1. Use Laravel Boost documentation search when it is installed and available
2. Or read the official docs page for that feature
3. Or read the installed vendor source directly

**If official documentation and the installed package source disagree, trust the installed package source.** It is what will actually run.

Do not proceed on training-data recall alone when verification is available. Silent assumption errors on post-cutoff APIs are the primary risk on this project.

```text
PHP 8.4+
Laravel 13
Filament 5          — all UI (app panel + admin panel), no separate frontend
Livewire 4          — within Filament only, no standalone Livewire pages
Tailwind CSS 4      — single pipeline via Filament
Alpine.js           — bundled with Filament/Livewire
Spatie Permission   — global roles only (Site Administrator)
Custom pivot        — subject_grade-scoped roles (see below)
Filament Shield     — admin panel access control
Laravel AI SDK      — in-editor AI suggestions and translation (gated by config flag `AI_SUGGESTIONS_ENABLED`)
Laravel Boost       — dev-time MCP server (use when available)
Laravel Shift Blueprint — scaffolding from draft.yaml
Pest                — all tests

## Critical naming conventions

| Term | Meaning | DB / Model |
|---|---|---|
| `Subject` | Academic discipline only — Mathematics, English, Science | `subjects` table, `Subject` model |
| `SubjectGrade` | Assignable unit: one subject + one integer grade | `subject_grades` table, `SubjectGrade` model |
| `SubjectGrade` | This is what roles, families, and user assignments attach to — not bare Subject | `subject_grade_user` pivot |
| Grade | Always an integer. Always displayed as "Grade N" | `subject_grades.grade` integer column |

`class` is a PHP reserved keyword. Never use it as a variable name (`$class`), method name, route segment (`/class`), or model name for the educational concept. The entity is always called `SubjectGrade`.

---

## Authorization model

- **Global roles** via Spatie: `site_administrator`
- **subject_grade-scoped roles** via custom `subject_grade_user` pivot — `role` enum: `editor`
- Subject Admin is stored as `subject_grades.subject_admin_user_id` (nullable FK) — **not** in the pivot
- Policies are the single source of truth for authorization — no ad hoc checks in components or controllers

Role scoping is **per subject_grade**, not per subject. A Math Grade 4 Subject Admin has zero authority over Math Grade 5.

When promoting a user to Subject Admin, always use a **service layer transaction** that:
1. Demotes the previous Subject Admin of the target `subject_grade` to Editor in the pivot
2. Sets `subject_grades.subject_admin_user_id = $userId` on the target `subject_grade`

Never update `subject_admin_user_id` directly without this full transaction. A partial update can leave a displaced Subject Admin without the expected fallback Editor role on the target `subject_grade`.

## DreamHost shared hosting constraints

DreamHost is the **primary production target**. Keep these constraints in mind whenever writing code or suggesting commands that will run in production.

### No Node.js on the server

DreamHost shared hosting does not have Node.js. All frontend assets (Vite, Tailwind, Filament) **must be compiled locally or in CI** before deployment. Never suggest `npm install`, `npm run build`, or any Node command as a server-side production step. The preferred deployment path is a CI pipeline that builds assets and uploads the compiled `public/build/` directory to DreamHost. Do not commit compiled assets to the repository.

### Tailwind CSS v4

This project uses Tailwind CSS v4, which is CSS-first. **Do not create or modify `tailwind.config.js`**. Theme customization belongs in `@theme {}` blocks inside the CSS entry file. Filament manages its own Tailwind pipeline via `@source` directives, not a JS config file.

### AI calls are synchronous

`QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync` on DreamHost means AI requests run inline in the HTTP request. Anthropic API calls can take 10 to 30 seconds. To prevent browser and PHP timeouts:
- **Always use streaming** when calling the Laravel AI SDK
- In Livewire components, stream the AI response into the UI as chunks arrive
- Add `php_value max_execution_time 60` to DreamHost `.htaccess`
- Call `set_time_limit(60)` at the start of the AI execution path
- Never design an AI interaction that waits for a full synchronous response before rendering anything

### MariaDB

DreamHost runs MariaDB. Partial or filtered unique indexes are a PostgreSQL feature and must not be used.

Uniqueness constraints use:
- **Nullable FK on parent record** — `lesson_plan_families.official_version_id`, `subject_grades.subject_admin_user_id`
- **Standard composite unique index** — `favorites (user_id, family_id)`
- **Service-layer transaction** — inverse constraints with no clean DB expression

Never suggest a `WHERE` clause on a `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` statement for this project.

The MariaDB version on DreamHost shared hosting may differ from the `mariadb:11` used in Docker. Write all migrations to be compatible with MariaDB 10.6+.

### Storage permissions

On DreamHost, PHP runs as the domain or SSH user via suEXEC, not as `www-data`. Set `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/` to `775` and ensure they are owned by your SSH user.

## Key data model facts

- `lesson_plan_families.official_version_id` — nullable FK to versions. Official status lives on the family, not the version
- `favorites (user_id, family_id, version_id)` — unique on `(user_id, family_id)`. One favorite per family per user
- `subject_grade_user` pivot stores `editor` role only. Subject Admin is stored on `subject_grades` directly
- All versions are immutable once saved. Editing always creates a new version
- First version in any new family is always `1.0.0`
- Exception: a family created by AI translation inherits the version number of the English source version
- System user (`system@ares.internal`, `is_system = true`) is seeded by `DatabaseSeeder`. Never expose it in user-facing UI

---

## Feature flags

AI suggestions and translation are gated by a direct config check: `config('features.ai_suggestions')`.
Pennant is not used. The config reads from `env('AI_SUGGESTIONS_ENABLED', false)`.
Neither button renders when the flag is off.

---

## Seeder split

- `DatabaseSeeder` — production-safe. Seeds System user and Site Admin only. Site Admin password comes from `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `DemoSeeder` — dev or demo only. Run with `php artisan db:seed --class=DemoSeeder`. Never on production

---

## Testing

All tests use **Pest**. Test files live in `tests/Feature` and `tests/Unit`.
Use per-agent fakes for AI SDK tests such as `LessonPlanAdvisor::fake()`. Never make real API calls in tests.
The full test checklist is in Section 17 of `Lesson2.md`.

---

## When in doubt

1. Check `Lesson2.md` — it is the canonical spec
2. Use Laravel Boost documentation search or official docs to verify the current API; if docs and installed source disagree, trust the installed source
3. Follow the shared framework rules in `AGENTS.md`
4. Choose the simplest maintainable option and document any deviation in `Lesson2.md`
5. Do not invent features not listed in the spec
